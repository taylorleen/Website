## Welcome to Food Addict

Have an obsession and addiction for all things sweet? Is dessert your favorite and first meal of the day? Me too. 

Check out the sweet treats that make my mouth smile.

### Ice Cream

Coffee is my favorite, but not just any type of coffee ice cream. The brand is very important. Turkey Hill to be exact. It has to have the right consistency of creaminess and richness and the coffee flavor has to be nothing but the strongest.
